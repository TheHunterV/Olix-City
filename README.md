Olix City

#Attention Most of the files in this server is free scripts, scripts that I gained permission to use, possibly paid scripts (those will be ommitted from
here, they are proected assets), or scripts that I have made personally. So the gameplay might not be like it is in the video. Just a heads up.

This is the home of Olix Server base. This still quite a bit of work to be done. Resources in this server could change. It will be an ever evolving project.
This server is created with a custom ESX version I call ESXM. It uses the same functions and such as ESX. I modified it to suit my needs. 
I am trying to create a server that is true to Real life, not just a grinding server. Where there is just people just grind for money all time with no RP.
The reason for this project is so that people can have fun and have time tell their characters story. 

# TO DO List.. 
Just about everything.

None of this proect is for sale one of it. None of the resources, Share it to your hearts desires.. All I ask is do not sell this. It is a labor of my love for FiveM
